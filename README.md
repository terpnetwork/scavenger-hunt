# scavenger-hunt
Welcome to the Terp Network Journey! The TerpNET Foundation is grateful you are joining us on our mission to build a hyperfocused ecosystem for all things terpene. This multi-month event serves multiple purposes and will be an exciting experience for all participants.

Firstly, we will introduce the Terp Network in a way that highlights the fundamentals required for participation. This will ensure that everyone is on the same page and has the necessary knowledge to fully participate.

Secondly, we will provide an incentive for participants to complete various tasks. This is not only to highlight the genuineness of participants but also to ensure everyone is fully engaged in the event.

Thirdly, this event is an opportunity for participants to receive feedback on the tooling they have deployed. This will help us improve and refine the overall experience for everyone.

Finally, this event will provide an on-chain record of participation for TestNET Airdrop allocations. This will allow us to keep track of everyone's contributions and ensure that the airdrop process is transparent and fair for all participants.

So, are you ready to join us on this exciting journey? Let's go!
